# Ecuflash Mitsubishi RVR Definitions

These Engine definitions included have been created By Professor_jonny to the best of my ability but are by no means finished or complete but what is there should be correct, they started with some part definitions I found on the net with some misaligned and incorrect/ missing tables.

I have studied the roms with Winols and by using pattern matching and hex editing and comparing other same generation roms and believe I have managed to get fairly decent maps.

The auto definitions is just modified definition for the auto 5 speed legnum gearbox from BCX on the OZVR4 forum, some tables seem to match up but is really not suitable for use.

The auto PCM unit has two processors on board and they are some what separate on the same PCB.

The ECU/ PCM Is based on the H8 chipset and requires a Openport 2.0 to safely read and write it can be read with the EVO5 template The transmission rom can only be read with MMCflash flash module as far as I am aware

vehicle support:
* Mitsubishi RVR N73WG auto and Manual transmission from 1997.11-2002.08
